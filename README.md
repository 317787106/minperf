# minperf
A Minimal Perfect Hash Function Library.

* Written in Java.
* Can generate, in linear time, MPHFs that need less than 1.52 bits per key.
* Concurrent generation.
* Two parameters to configure space needed, generation time, and evaluation time.
* Performance very similar than the [Sux4J](https://github.com/vigna/Sux4J) CHD and GOV algorithms, but configurable, with ability to use less space.
